      E-Bank is the oldest commercial bank in Egypt. It was established on June 25, 1898 with a capital of £ 1 million. Throughout its long history, E-Bank's functions and roles have continually developed to square with the different economic and political stages in Egypt. During the 1950s, E-Bank assumed the central bank's duties. After its nationalization in the 1960s, it acted as a pure commercial bank besides carrying out the functions of the central bank in the areas where the latter had no branches. Moreover, since mid-1960s, E-Bank has been in charge of issuing and managing investment certificates on behalf of the government.

During FY 2019/2020, E-Bank managed to achieve unprecedented performance indicators. Total financial position as at the end of June 2020 recorded EGP 2 trillion, growing 23% yoy. Accordingly, E-Bank's total assets accounted for 31.5% of Egyptian banks' total assets. E-Bank's financial position continued to scale up to EGP 2.5 trillion as at end-March 2021.
<br><br>
Total deposits reached EGP 1.6 trillion as at end-June 2020, with a growth rate of 36% yoy, accounting for 34% of total banks' deposits. Such leap was driven by the introduction of a diversified package of deposits in local and foreign currencies at competitively lucrative rates.

<br><br>

E-Bank has further provided a set of distinguished finance schemes that meet the needs of key economic sectors. As at the end of June 2020, the total retail loan portfolio grew by EGP 29 bn., i.e. 40%, yoy, to reach EGP 102 bn., of which EGP 10 bn. were extended to 94,000 customers as part of the Central Bank of Egypt's (CBE) initiative for mortgage finance. Retail loans continuously went up to reach EGP 130 bn. as at end-March 2021.
